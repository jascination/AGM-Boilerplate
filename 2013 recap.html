							For many men, throwing down a few thousand dollars on new clothes in a big deal. Daunting, of course, because of the huge effect that a whole new wardrobe can have on your life, your confidence and people's perception of you.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>But what if you're spending a few thousand dollars every day?</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							For those new to this site, A Good Man's main service is personal styling. We meet clients, assess their needs and budget and help them curate a wardrobe that will help them become the man they feel like on the inside. Sounds cheesy, I know, but it's a huge transformation and a pretty sweet job.
						</p>
						<p>
							First, here are some stats from 2013. 
						</p>
						<img src="article-imgs/2013-stats.png" />

						<h2 class="fancywhiskey">Our feet still hurt from all that walking.</h2>

						<p>That's a lot of clients, a lot of money and a lot of guys feeling great about themselves. That $200,000 is money we don't earn commission on; all cash that goes directly to small retail businesses.</p>

						<p>But enough stats. Here's a list of things we learned after trying on pretty much every item of clothing in Australia.</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Fat Men Don' thave Fat Legs</li>
							<li>Evertibe us 4 sizes smaller than they think</li>
							<li>Colour theory is mostly bullshit</li>
							<li>Men have trouble letting go of clothes (sentimental vs stuff they actually wear)</li>
							<li>Everyone looks good in Filippa K Chinos</li>
							<li>Men want to be comfortable: the 2014 look</li>
							<li>Men want minimal effort in their wardrobe</li>
							<li>We all have a fashion nemesis: the well-dressed guy that we hate</li>
							<li>Shopping at bricks-and-mortar stores is way less stressful than men think it will be: "In defence of shopping offline"</li>
							<li>Pants set the occasion</li>
							<li>Changing a wardrobe is a therepeutic experience. A lot of stuff comes out in the process.</li>
							<li>You have to give a shit before you can not give a shit: on knowing the rules before you break them</li>
							<li>Everyone has a "thing" they're self-conscious about re.clothes</li>
							<li>Intimidation in high-end stores -> do a photoshoot in Harrolds</li>
							<li>Clothing is about relationships. Tailor, shop owner, etc</li>
