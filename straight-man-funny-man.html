						<h1>Straight Man / Funny Man</h1>
						
						<p>Today's course is one of our favourites for teaching our clients - a unique system we developed to help our clients understand how to put together outfits that look unique but don't go too over-the-top.</p>
						
						<p><strong>??? In our first lesson we talked about trying to look at your clothes as an entity - as a wardrobe - rather than individual pieces. ????</strong>. The same applies here. When you wear clothes, they don't just sit there on their own. If someone compliments your cool jacket, they're not actually just complimenting the jacket - but the outfit that supports it and allows it to look cool.</p>

						<p>A great way to visualise this is similar to a classic comedy duo, where you have a <strong>straight man</strong>, whose role is to act 'normal' and (not fight for the audience's attention) and a <strong>funny man</strong>, whose role is to be 'odd', to be wacky, to be the source of interest that makes the act worth watching.</p>

						<p>In clothes, as in comedy, if you have only straight-men then your outfits are boring; nothing is different or interesting or attention-grabbing. By the same token, if you only have funny-men, then there's no clean foundation; everything is vying for attention and it becomes overwhelming.</p>

						<p>The 'funny man' does not necessarily mean something crazily loud or colourful. While it can certainly be these things, it can also be a piece worn in an interesting way, an unusual texture or a novel combination of two items which work together to form a unique look.</p>

						<p><strong>Here are some examples of straight-man/funny-man in action</strong></p>

						<p>The task for today is to involve straight-man/funny-man in an outfit. Use the examples above as inspiration. ???(For corporate guys who work in a conservative environment, here are some exmaples.)???</p>
