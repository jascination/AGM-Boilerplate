						<h1>A Minimalistic Wardrobe</h1>
						
						Minimalism is such an important concept to understand when building a wardrobe up from scratch. By "minimalism" I don't mean buying fewer pieces of clothing - although this is important too, as you want to avoid wasting space in your closet and want all of your clothes to be as versatile and useful as possible.

						But here, minimalism refers to design in clothing.

						

						What is a basic wardrobe?
						A wardrobe is not a collection individual pieces; it's an entity. Everything should work together, everything should fit into different outfits. Everything should be congruent.

						If you came to me and said you (a) were only just getting interested in men's fashion, or (b) wanted to throw everything out and transform your entire wardrobe, I'd start by getting you a basic wardrobe.

						The basic wardrobe has two main goals:

						Everything should go with everything else. When you're starting a new wardrobe you don't want pieces in there that only go with one or two things. Really, you want to be able to close your eyes, pick any shirt, and jacket, any pants and any pair of shoes and it should instantly be a great outfit.
						Everything should be minimally designed. That is, less features, less additions, less detail.
						Why minimal? Because minimal is easy to match. Think of a plain white t-shirt (there's a big selection of them here) . The plain ones go with just about everything. But the more detail, visual interest and features that you add, the more that they become harder to match with other items in your wardrobe. In fact, if you get a really complicated, busy t-shirt, you can only really match it well with other items that are minimal too.

						Here's how I define a basic wardrobe:
						Chinos

						I call these the dressy alternative to jeans. They're the perfect balance between formal and casual and can be dressed down as easily as up. There's a whole bunch of colours and varieties here. They go with pretty much anything, especially the varieties that have less detail, fewer pockets and discrete embellishments.

						Dress Shirts

						The term "dress shirts" doesn't mean you can only wear them in a formal way; it means they can be worn in a dressy way. In line with our 'minimalistic' mindset, this makes them perfect for a basic wardrobe as they have very few details that will clash with other items you might own.

						In terms of quality, J.Crew has some really great pieces that not only look great but also last a long time. I personally pair these shirts with a blazer from Acne Studios all the time which creates some of my most complimented outfits.

						Jackets

						If you want one jacket to rule them all, it's the navy blazer, without a doubt. Here's a bunch of them for you to look through. A blazer is a mid-point between a suit jacket and a casual jacket. It's generally cut a bit higher in the waist, so that when you put it with a pair of jeans or chinos it dones't look as though it's a suit jacket that somehow got mismatched into a different outfit.

						There are many variations of jackets that would suit a basic wardrobe. Beyond a blazer, there's a harrington, a varsity jacket and the coat, be it trench, peacoat or mac. All would do quite well in a basic wardrobe as they're all quite simple styles.

						Shoes

						Shoes make the outfit. From something quite dressy to something quite casual tosomething in-between, a pair of shoes sets the occasion and level of formality of an outfit. Some of my personal favourites include those from Allen Edmonds (for dress shoes), and Common Projects (for casual shoes). The latter may seem expensive for sneakers, but until you've tried on a pair you really have no idea how amazing they are. The black, white and taupe 'Achilles' are my favourite, they are arguably some of the most versatile shoes out there.
